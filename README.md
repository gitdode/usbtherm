The purpose of this project is to provide a basic but complete example of a Linux USB kernel driver module and a simple USB device.

This repository contains three projects:

* usbtherm-avr - USB thermometer based on an AVR micro controller and the V-USB firmware-only USB implementation
* usbtherm-linux - Basic but complete Linux kernel USB character driver module
* usbtherm-ui - Simple Java desktop application displaying the temperature

The project usbtherm-avr contains a KiCad project including schematic and PCB layout.

The 3 PCBs are currently being manufactured at <a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/NU2Iejeb">OSH Park</a> :-)

A detailed description of the project follows.
