This repository contains three projects:

* usbtherm-avr - USB thermometer based on an AVR micro controller and the V-USB firmware-only USB implementation
* usbtherm-linux - Basic but complete Linux kernel USB character driver module
* usbtherm-ui - Simple Java desktop application

The project usbtherm-avr contains a KiCad project including schematic and PCB layout.

The first (and untested!) PCBs are currently being manufactured at <a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/NU2Iejeb">OSH Park</a> :-)

A detailed description of the project follows.
